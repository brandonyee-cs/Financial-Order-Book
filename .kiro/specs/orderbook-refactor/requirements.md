# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing orderbook implementation to resolve critical architectural issues and create a production-ready, high-performance trading system. The current implementation suffers from type inconsistencies, incomplete matching logic, missing dependencies, and build system problems that prevent it from functioning as intended.

The refactored system must maintain the performance characteristics outlined in the README (500,000+ orders/sec, <50μs latency) while providing a complete, working orderbook with FIX protocol support, risk management, and market data publishing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Type System Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type definitions across all components, so that the system compiles without type conflicts and maintains type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is compiled THEN all OrderId types SHALL be consistently defined across Order.hpp, OrderBook.hpp, and Types.hpp
2. WHEN using templated components THEN the template parameters SHALL be consistently applied throughout the codebase
3. IF a component uses OrderId THEN it SHALL use the same type definition from a single source header
4. WHEN price and quantity types are referenced THEN they SHALL use consistent type aliases from Types.hpp

### Requirement 2: Unified OrderBook Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a single, coherent OrderBook design approach, so that there are no conflicting implementations causing linking errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OrderBook is implemented THEN it SHALL use either a templated OR non-templated approach consistently
2. WHEN OrderBook.hpp is included THEN it SHALL match the implementation in OrderBook.cpp exactly
3. IF templated approach is chosen THEN all template parameters SHALL be properly defined and used
4. WHEN the system links THEN there SHALL be no undefined symbol errors related to OrderBook methods

### Requirement 3: Complete Order Matching Engine

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a fully functional order matching engine, so that my orders are properly matched, executed, and reported according to price-time priority.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a buy order is added at or above the best ask price THEN the system SHALL execute matching trades immediately
2. WHEN a sell order is added at or below the best bid price THEN the system SHALL execute matching trades immediately
3. WHEN orders match THEN the system SHALL generate fill reports with correct quantities and prices
4. WHEN partial fills occur THEN the remaining quantity SHALL stay in the book at the original price
5. WHEN multiple orders exist at the same price THEN they SHALL be matched in time priority (FIFO)
6. WHEN the best bid/ask changes THEN the system SHALL update market data immediately

### Requirement 4: Risk Management Integration

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want integrated risk controls, so that orders are validated against position limits, price limits, and order size limits before execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate it against maximum order size limits
2. WHEN an order would exceed position limits THEN the system SHALL reject the order with appropriate error message
3. WHEN an order price is outside acceptable ranges THEN the system SHALL reject the order
4. IF risk limits are configured THEN they SHALL be loaded from the configuration file
5. WHEN risk violations occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate severity level

### Requirement 5: Market Data Publishing

**User Story:** As a market data consumer, I want real-time market data updates, so that I can track order book changes, trades, and best bid/offer prices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the best bid or ask changes THEN the system SHALL publish a market data update
2. WHEN a trade occurs THEN the system SHALL publish trade information including price, quantity, and timestamp
3. WHEN order book depth changes THEN the system SHALL publish level-by-level updates
4. IF market data subscribers exist THEN they SHALL receive updates within 10μs of the triggering event
5. WHEN market data is published THEN it SHALL include sequence numbers for gap detection

### Requirement 6: FIX Protocol Support

**User Story:** As a trading client, I want to connect via FIX 4.4 protocol, so that I can send orders, receive executions, and get market data using industry-standard messaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a FIX session is established THEN the system SHALL authenticate and maintain the connection
2. WHEN a NewOrderSingle message is received THEN the system SHALL parse and process the order
3. WHEN an order is executed THEN the system SHALL send ExecutionReport messages to the client
4. WHEN order modifications are requested THEN the system SHALL process OrderCancelReplaceRequest messages
5. IF FIX message parsing fails THEN the system SHALL send appropriate reject messages
6. WHEN network connections are lost THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want runtime configuration capabilities, so that I can adjust system parameters without recompiling the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from config/orderbook.cfg
2. WHEN configuration values are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults
3. IF configuration file is malformed THEN the system SHALL log errors and use defaults
4. WHEN risk limits are configured THEN they SHALL be applied to all order validation
5. WHEN network settings are configured THEN they SHALL be used for FIX protocol connections

### Requirement 8: Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orders are processed THEN the system SHALL log order lifecycle events
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate severity levels
3. WHEN performance metrics are available THEN they SHALL be logged periodically
4. IF log level is configured THEN only messages at or above that level SHALL be written
5. WHEN log files reach size limits THEN they SHALL be rotated automatically

### Requirement 9: Build System Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working build system, so that I can compile and link the application successfully with all dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CMakeLists.txt is processed THEN it SHALL reference all existing source files correctly
2. WHEN the build is executed THEN all dependencies SHALL be found and linked properly
3. WHEN Boost libraries are required THEN they SHALL be detected and linked automatically
4. IF source files are missing THEN the build SHALL fail with clear error messages
5. WHEN the executable is built THEN it SHALL run without missing symbol errors

### Requirement 10: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the system to meet stated performance targets, so that it can handle high-frequency trading workloads effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing orders THEN the system SHALL achieve <50μs latency for order adds
2. WHEN canceling orders THEN the system SHALL achieve <10μs latency
3. WHEN querying best prices THEN the system SHALL respond in <1μs
4. IF memory usage is measured THEN it SHALL not exceed 128 bytes per active order
5. WHEN throughput is tested THEN the system SHALL handle 500,000+ orders per second

### Requirement 11: Demo Application

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want a recording-ready demo application, so that I can showcase the orderbook functionality and verify the system works end-to-end from the terminal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the demo is launched THEN it SHALL run a complete orderbook simulation from the command line
2. WHEN the demo executes THEN it SHALL display real-time order book state, trades, and market data updates
3. WHEN orders are processed THEN the demo SHALL show order lifecycle events including adds, modifications, cancellations, and executions
4. WHEN trades occur THEN the demo SHALL display trade details with prices, quantities, and timestamps
5. IF the demo runs for 30 seconds THEN it SHALL demonstrate all core orderbook operations including matching, risk checks, and market data publishing
6. WHEN the demo completes THEN it SHALL output performance statistics showing latency and throughput metrics
7. WHEN launched with --demo flag THEN the system SHALL run the demonstration scenario automatically without user input
